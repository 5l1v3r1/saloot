print("               __            __ ")
print("   _________ _/ /___  ____  / /_")

print("As your assistant, I will be responsible for responding to your messages in your absence.")
print("To activate me, type saloot. If you wish to deactivate me, type bye in this console or use CTRL+C.")

        print("Goodbye")
        exit
elif choice == "saloot":
        # Scan the QR code before pressing any key.
        input('Please scan the QR code and then hit enter.')
        done = False
        while done == False:
                try:
                        # Find newest unread message
                        user = driver.find_element_by_xpath('//span[@class = "{}"]//ancestor::div[4]'.format("OUeyt"))
                        user.click()
                        # Find textbox
                        msg_box = driver.find_element_by_class_name('_2S1VP')
                        for elem in driver.find_elements_by_xpath('.//span[@class = "selectable-text invisible-space copyable-text"]'):

                                #print(elem.text)
                        msg = str(bot.get_response(receivedmsg))
                        # Tell receiver that this message is from a bot
                        msg_box.send_keys("{0} is currently unavailable. You are currently chatting with his bot, Saloot.".format(name))
                        button = driver.find_element_by_xpath("(//div[@class='weEq5'])[2]").click()
                        try:
                                button.click()
                        except AttributeError as e:
                                print('')
                        msg_box.send_keys(msg)
                        button = driver.find_element_by_xpath("(//div[@class='weEq5'])[2]").click()
                        try:
                                button.click()
                        except AttributeError as e:
                                print('')
                        print('I just sent one reply.')
                        print('If you would like to deactivate me, press CTRL+C.')
                except NoSuchElementException as e2:
                        print('Waiting for new messages...')
                        time.sleep(2) # sleep for two seconds
